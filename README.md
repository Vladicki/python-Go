# Python-Go

A fully custom **Game of Go** implementation built from scratch using **Python** and **Qt6**.

This project showcases a dynamic, fully interactive Go board with a complete scoring system, all designed and developed by us.

---

## Project Overview

We designed and coded every aspect of the game:  
- The Go board dynamically updates with every move  
- A robust scoring system tracks territory and captures  
- All game logic and UI components built from the ground up  

The entire project strictly follows **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, emphasizing clean code structure, modularity, and comprehensive comments for maintainability and clarity.
